Currently, I'm working at Acer and I have been here for about 2 years, This has become s a stable environment, in other words, this kind of environment reduces my Competitiveness. For past 2 years, I've been working as solution architect and focused on system design and integration. according to this role, I've learned the tasks and schedule management with our vendors. The programming works are rely on our vendor. Its a pure trade off, there aren't as many opportunities to practice the programming skills.

My name is Echo, I've been working as software developer for more than 10 years. when i was student, I was a failure. In those years, there was nothing i had to worry about but study. but I didn't concentrate on study! I gathered a band, played guitar all day. and fortunately got a contract from a local studio! What a wonderful life. You may know the artist have strong personality, I was kicked out of school. not only the student career stopped! but also may family's business stopped too! Suddenly I lost. everything was gone. but thankful. I have my family! We supported each other. After the cross road of my life, I realized nothing comes for free and learned to treasure everything around me.

# what's your idea job

Nothing comes for free. I really treasure and thankful to my family. The first priority is to achieve work life balance. Besides, in my experience I joined small scale company and also cross country company. Met lots of colleagues and realize the crab theory. One crab in a bucket. It can escape easily. But many crabs? They would catch and pull someone who is climbing ! I like co-work with ace! Excited right?

# what's your weakness

I worked at Trendmicro. one of my projects was working with EMEA engineers. I was assigned as a host of a meeting. It was a disaster! Few days later, I heard a feedback from my colleague, saying: Is Echo a barbarian? (uncivilized) It hurt me very very much. Since thant time I've been afraid of English. I’m Sorry for telling this story. At the same time, it gave me a push and motivation to move forward and to improve myself.

# what's your strength

I believe  I am Creative. I am able to Analyze things from several dimensions and also accept different opinions. But that does not mean my decision could be impacted easily. In addition, Due to the artist temperament, I feel convinced only after proper evidence has been provided.
I am also very persevering, I tend to keep going until the objective has been reached. 



# what are your professional achievements?

Micro-service was a new design methodology in 2015 Taiwan. At that time, I was a member in ECommerce team in Trendmicro and have been assigned to engage with Micro-service. During the adoption, each team had to propose their service model and integration method to other service teams. After that, The committee would also review the architecture to see if it meets the micro-service requirement. I was chosen by my team to carry out the micro-service's architecture. 

It was a challenge for me, because i didn't have any experience about micro-service. at the beginning, my design was always rejected by the committee; eventually, I was able to resolve all the design issues and meet the MS requirements. It's a big milestone in my career.

# why should Microsoft hire you?

In my past career, all interviews would focus on the understanding of programming language, framework and used library. From the other angle/point of view, those companies were recruiting a programmer only. But Trendmicro. they focus on the personality and the potential, So, apart from hard skills, it is important to be a team player, to fit into the environment well. 

And again, at some point in my life, I was lost and it made me realize nothing comes for free. therefore, I always set the bar high and do my best to achieve the goal (and treasure any returns deeply). In addition, Creative thinking is my other skill. I found lots of projects blind areas, therefore we managed to avoid critical defects. Maybe that's why I was promoted as a Solution architect.
