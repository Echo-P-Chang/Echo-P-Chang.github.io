I was a pilot of my team to carry team into micro-service's world. It's a milestone in my career.



# why should Microsoft hire you?

In my past career, all interviews are focus on the understanding of programming language, framework and used library. From the other angel of view, those companies are recruiting only a programmer. But Trendmicro. they focus on the personality and the potential ,bla bla bla~~~~

And again, I was lost and realize nothing comes for free. therefore, I always do my best to achieve the goal and treasure very much for any returns. In addition, Creative thinking is my other skill. I've found lots projects blink area to avoid critical defect. Maybe that's why I was promoted as a Solution architect.
